Adjusting the _delay_ms() function in your stepper motor control code is crucial for achieving the desired performance. The appropriate delay depends on several parameters specific to your stepper motor and application. Here are the key parameters you should look for in the stepper motor datasheet:

Step Angle (or Step Resolution):
The step angle is the angle through which the motor rotates for each step. It is usually given in degrees. The step resolution is the number of steps per revolution. The relationship between the step angle, step resolution, and the number of steps per revolution is important for determining the delay.

Maximum Speed (Steps per Second or RPM):
Stepper motors have a maximum speed at which they can reliably operate. This is usually specified in terms of steps per second or revolutions per minute (RPM). The datasheet might provide information on the maximum speed under different conditions.

Acceleration and Deceleration Rates:
Some applications require acceleration and deceleration profiles to smoothly start and stop the motor. Look for acceleration and deceleration specifications in the datasheet. These parameters can influence the delay between steps.

Load Inertia:
The load inertia, including the motor rotor inertia and the inertia of the connected load, affects the motor's ability to accelerate and decelerate. Higher inertia might require longer delays to prevent overshooting.

Pull-in Torque:
The pull-in torque is the minimum torque required for the motor to overcome static friction and start moving. It is essential for determining the minimum delay required for reliable motion.

Drive Voltage and Current:
The drive voltage and current affect the motor's performance. Ensure that you are providing the motor with the recommended voltage and current, as specified in the datasheet.

Microstepping:
If you are using microstepping to achieve smoother motion, the datasheet might specify the microstep resolution and any considerations for timing.

Backlash:
Backlash in the mechanical system can affect the accuracy of the motor's movement. While not directly related to the delay, it's a factor that can impact overall system performance.

Operating Temperature Range:
Stepper motors can exhibit different characteristics at different temperatures. Ensure that your application falls within the specified operating temperature range for accurate timing.

When adjusting the _delay_ms() function, consider the time it takes for the motor to complete one step, taking into account the step angle and desired speed. The formula for calculating the delay between steps is:

Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach, and real-world applications might require fine-tuning based on the specific motor and system dynamics. Experimentation and observation are often necessary to achieve optimal performance.
